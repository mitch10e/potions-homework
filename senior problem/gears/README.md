# Gears

For this problem I spent about an hour trying to solve what the algorithm was, but was unable to do so (See Notes folder images for notebook references). I then decided that I wanted to
at least get the programming experince in Elixir, so I began to google what the problem was, learned a bit of background history about the
secret society known as the Google foobar challenges, and found a few examples of how to solve the "Gearing up for destruction" problem.

I acknowledge that any work turned in for this project is not solely my own, as I did not solve the algorithm without outside passive resources.
However, any coding done in this Elixir project was of my own work and design, in as much as working the algorithm to conform to recursion, etc.

This one is the simplest in terms of the algorithm, as it tries to explain the basic math behind the problem. I've read it a couple of times now, but I don't think
I'm going to understand it this late. I'll probably try reading it again over the weekend.

I think my main weakness on this was recognizing how to find this equation. I'm still kind of puzzled at how people know to make the sign alternate between distances,
as well as if it should be 1 or 1/3 sized gears.
