Elixir is the mighty ether!

This repository represents my work for an interview task set to me by a company that (hopefully) will not be mentioned anywhere in this repository. The life of this repo will not be very long, as once the process is over I will either delete or privatize this repo so that it doesn't cause any problems for the recruiters looking to use this same problem in the future.

The prompt will not be provided, as it was explicitly stated to not include it anywhere in git. As such, I will describe the problem as best I can in comments so that those seeing it can at least understand what is going on.
